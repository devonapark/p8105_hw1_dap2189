\#Problem 1

This problem focuses the use of inline R code, plotting, and the
behavior of ggplot for variables of different types.

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

Note: I used below line in the console to see the first 6 rows (making
sure I installed it correctly: `head(early_january_weather)`

This dataset looks at weather conditions in early January. This dataset
has 358 rows, 15 columns, and a mean temperature of 39.58 degrees.

Variables in this dataset include: origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour. A summary of the variables and significant values can be seen
below.

Based on the below scatterplot, it appears that temperature increases as
we get later into January. As well, there is a similar trend with
humidity: later in the month when the temperatures are higher, the
humidity index increases.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_dap2189_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("january_weather_and_humidity.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

\#Problem 2

This problem is intended to emphasize variable types and introduce
coercion; some awareness of how R treats numeric, character, and factor
variables is necessary for working with these data types in practice.

``` r
Problem2_df = tibble(
    random_number = rnorm(10),
    logical_greater_than_0 = random_number > 0,
    character_var = c("My", "name", "is", "Jeff", "and", "I", "a","professor", "at", "Mailman"),
    factor_size = factor(c("Small", "Medium", "Large", "Small", "Medium", "Large","Small", "Medium", "Large","Small"))
)
```

Notes on creating a data frame comprised of: factor_var =
factor(c(“male”, “male”, “female”, “female”)) –\> is there a way to do
this without writing out all 10 times?

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and
what doesn’t?

``` r
mean(pull(Problem2_df,random_number))
```

    ## [1] 0.2755027

``` r
mean(pull(Problem2_df,logical_greater_than_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(Problem2_df,character_var))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(Problem2_df, character_var)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(Problem2_df,factor_size))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(Problem2_df, factor_size)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We need to use the pull function to pull the variable out of the
dataset.

The mean of variable, “random_number” is 0.2755027 and the mean of
variable, “logical_greater_than_0” is 0.6. I cannot get the mean of
variables “character_var” and “factor_size” becuase they are non-numeric
values. The logical variable can be used in calculations because it gets
a value of 1 if random_variable is greater than 0 or 0 if less than 0.

Using `as.numeric()` to force a variable from original form into
numeric:

``` r
as.numeric(Problem2_df$logical_greater_than_0)
as.numeric(Problem2_df$character_var)
as.numeric(Problem2_df$factor_size)
```

With the logical variable, it prints out values of 0 and 1. With the
character variable, it says “NA”. I think this is because it cant
convert text to numbers. With the factor variable, because it creates
three categories, perhaps it assigns a value of 1-3 to each string
value, and then outputs the number associated with the category. (ex.
3=small, 2=medium, 1=large)
